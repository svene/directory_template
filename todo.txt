READY:

BACKLOG:
========
- store inputparameters/derived properties in '.meta/directorytemplate/...' so that proceeding directorytemplate calls
  can reuse them. E.g. using smkdir simplejava (which takes a 'packagename') and then calling smkdir gradle should
  reuse packagedir for the application plugin in the generated 'build.gradle'
- smkdir call should not modify files from previous run

DONE:
